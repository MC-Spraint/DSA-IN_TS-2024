## Description



This repository is a comprehensive collection of solutions to data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, designed to aid individuals in their journey to master DSA concepts and ace technical interviews. Written entirely in TypeScript, it offers solutions to a wide range of problems, from beginner to advanced levels.
This includes Commonly asked Interview questions from DSA, NodeJs, Typescript/Javascript, Solid principles, High level and Low level system design, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Angular, React. Also includes **'Leetcode Top 150'**, **'Leetcode Ace Interview With 75'** and **'Leetcode Javascript 30'** questions solutions.
Although I am still working in it but I'm trying my best to depict my entire interview preperation journey though this repository.

Key Features:

#### DSA Solutions: 
Contains detailed solutions to a diverse set of DSA problems, covering topics from as arrays, strings, hashmaps, stacks, queues, two-pointers, sliding-window, sorting, searching to advanced comcepts like trees, graphs, dynamic programming and you name it.

#### Interview Preparation: 
Offers solutions to the LeetCode Top 150 Questions and LeetCode Ace the Interview with 75 Questions, providing invaluable insights and strategies for tackling challenging interview problems and their hand written notes.
Handwritten Notes for also NodeJs, Javascript, PSQL and MongoDB, etc, etc.


1. **JavaScript 30:** 
Includes solutions to the JavaScript 30 challenge series, reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals.

2. **Leetcode Top 150:**
I have provided all 150 questions solutions with small handwritten notes and though process

3. **Leetcode Ace Interview With 75:**
I have provided all 150 questions solutions with small handwritten notes and though process

4. **Handwritten Notes:**
I have provided handwritten notes for every concepts that are here in this repository,including notes for solution of every problems solutions and my thought process behind them

How to Use:
