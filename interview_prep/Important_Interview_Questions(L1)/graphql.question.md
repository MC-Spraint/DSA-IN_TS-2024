# Top 20 GraphQL Interview Questions

1. **What is GraphQL and how does it differ from REST?**
   - Explanation: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. Unlike REST, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more.

2. **What are the main components of a GraphQL architecture?**
   - Explanation: The main components include schemas, queries, mutations, resolvers, and the GraphQL server.

3. **What is a GraphQL schema and how do you define it?**
   - Explanation: A schema defines the types and relationships in your GraphQL API. It is defined using a schema definition language (SDL).

4. **Explain the difference between queries and mutations in GraphQL.**
   - Explanation: Queries are used to fetch data, while mutations are used to modify data on the server.

5. **What are resolvers in GraphQL? How do they work?**
   - Explanation: Resolvers are functions that resolve the value of a type or field in a schema. They are responsible for fetching the data requested by a query.

6. **How do you handle errors in GraphQL?**
   - Explanation: Errors in GraphQL are handled by returning an `errors` field in the response, which contains information about what went wrong.

7. **What is the N+1 problem in GraphQL and how can you solve it?**
   - Explanation: The N+1 problem occurs when querying nested fields, leading to multiple database requests. It can be solved using data loader libraries or batching techniques.

8. **Explain what GraphQL fragments are and how to use them.**
   - Explanation: Fragments allow you to reuse parts of queries, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

9. **What are GraphQL subscriptions and when would you use them?**
   - Explanation: Subscriptions are used to maintain a real-time connection to the server, allowing clients to receive updates when data changes.

10. **How do you implement pagination in GraphQL?**
    - Explanation: Pagination can be implemented using either offset-based or cursor-based approaches, often utilizing the `first`, `last`, `before`, and `after` arguments.

11. **Describe the difference between inline fragments and named fragments in GraphQL.**
    - Explanation: Inline fragments are used for conditional queries directly within a query, while named fragments are reusable query components defined separately.

12. **What is introspection in GraphQL?**
    - Explanation: Introspection is a feature that allows clients to query the schema itself to understand what queries are possible.

13. **How do you secure a GraphQL API?**
    - Explanation: Security in GraphQL can be managed through authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.

14. **What is Apollo Client and how is it used with GraphQL?**
    - Explanation: Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.

15. **Explain the role of middleware in a GraphQL server.**
    - Explanation: Middleware can be used to add custom logic such as authentication, logging, or data transformation to the request pipeline.

16. **What are some common tools or libraries used with GraphQL?**
    - Explanation: Common tools include Apollo Server, GraphQL.js, Relay, Prisma, and GraphiQL.

17. **How do you handle versioning in a GraphQL API?**
    - Explanation: GraphQL encourages evolving the schema in a backwards-compatible way, reducing the need for versioning. When necessary, versioning can be managed through schema extensions or custom directives.

18. **What are custom scalars in GraphQL and how do you define them?**
    - Explanation: Custom scalars are user-defined types that extend the built-in scalar types. They are defined in the schema and require custom parsing and validation logic.

19. **How do you perform authorization in a GraphQL resolver?**
    - Explanation: Authorization can be implemented by checking user roles or permissions within resolvers, often using middleware or helper functions.

20. **What are some best practices for designing a GraphQL schema?**
    - Explanation: Best practices include keeping the schema simple and intuitive, using descriptive naming conventions, modularizing schema definitions, and ensuring proper documentation.
