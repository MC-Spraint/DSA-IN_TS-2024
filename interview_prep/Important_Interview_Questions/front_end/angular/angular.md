## What are Angular components?
Components are the building blocks of Angular applications. They encapsulate the template, data, and behavior of a view. Each component consists of a TypeScript class with properties and methods, an HTML template, and optional CSS styles.

## What is data binding in Angular?
Data binding in Angular allows synchronization of data between the component and the view. There are four types of data binding:

1. Interpolation      {{value}}
2. Property binding   [style]
3. Attribute binding  [attr.style]
4. Event binding      (click) => "onClick($event)
5. Two-way binding    [(ngModel)]

## Explain Angular services and their significance.
Services are singleton objects in Angular that provide reusable business logic and data manipulation. They are used to share data and functionality across components, modules, or the entire application. Services are typically injected into components or other services using dependency injection.

## What is dependency injection (DI) in Angular?
Dependency injection is a design pattern used in Angular to manage the dependencies of components and services. It allows the framework to create and inject instances of required dependencies into classes at runtime, making components and services more modular, reusable, and testable.

## What are Angular directives?
Directives are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to do something with that element or its children. They extend HTML with new attributes and tags to provide reusable functionality, such as structural directives (ngIf, ngFor) and attribute directives (ngModel, ngStyle).

## Explain Angular routing and its advantages.
Angular routing is a mechanism for navigating between different views (components) in a single-page application. It allows developers to define routes, map them to components, and handle navigation programmatically or through user interactions. Angular routing improves user experience, SEO, and code organization.

## What are Angular templates?
Angular templates are HTML files with Angular-specific syntax that define the view of a component. They include data bindings, directives, and other Angular features to render dynamic content based on the component's properties and methods.

## What is Angular CLI, and why is it used?
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool for scaffolding, building, and managing Angular applications. It provides commands for generating components, services, modules, and other artifacts, as well as for serving, building, and testing Angular applications. Angular CLI simplifies and automates common development tasks.

## Explain Angular forms and their types.
Angular forms are used for collecting and validating user input in Angular applications. There are two types of Angular forms:
Template-driven forms: Forms defined in the template using directives like ngModel and ngForm.
Reactive forms: Forms defined programmatically using FormControl, FormGroup, and FormBuilder classes.

## What is Angular interpolation?
Angular interpolation is a data binding technique used to display dynamic values in the view. It uses double curly braces ({{}}) to evaluate and render expressions or variables from the component's class into the HTML template.

## What is Angular HTTP client, and how is it used?
Angular HTTP client is a built-in module for making HTTP requests in Angular applications. It provides methods for performing GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP operations asynchronously. Angular HTTP client also supports features like request/response interception, error handling, and HTTP headers.

## Explain Angular pipes and their significance.
Angular pipes are used for transforming data in Angular templates. They are simple functions that accept input data and return transformed output data, such as formatting dates, numbers, strings, or applying custom transformations. Pipes can be chained together and used with interpolation or data binding.

## What is Angular testing, and how is it performed?
Angular testing involves writing and running tests to verify the behavior and functionality of Angular components, services, and other parts of the application. Angular provides built-in testing utilities like TestBed, ComponentFixture, and async/await for writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like Jasmine and Karma.

## What is lazy loading in Angular?
Lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of modules or components until they are needed. In Angular, lazy loading improves application performance by reducing the initial bundle size and loading only the necessary code chunks when navigating to a specific route or feature.

## What are Angular decorators, and how are they used?
Angular decorators are functions that modify the behavior of classes, methods, or properties in Angular applications. They are used to annotate and configure Angular components, services, modules, and other elements. Examples of Angular decorators include @Component, @Injectable, @NgModule, @Input, @Output, etc.

## What are the key features of Angular?
Two-way data binding
Dependency injection
Directives for extending HTML
Services for reusable business logic
Routing for single-page applications
Forms handling
Modular architecture with NgModule

## Explain the difference between AngularJS and Angular.
AngularJS is the first version of the framework, also known as Angular 1.x, whereas Angular refers to the subsequent versions (Angular 2 and above).
AngularJS is built on JavaScript, while Angular is built on TypeScript.
AngularJS uses controllers and $scope, while Angular uses components and directives.
AngularJS has limited support for mobile development, while Angular has better support through Angular Mobile Toolkit.

## What is TypeScript, and why is it used in Angular?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. It is used in Angular to enhance code quality, improve developer productivity, and enable features like type checking and ES6/ES7 compatibility.

## Explain Angular modules (NgModule).
NgModule is a decorator function that defines a module in Angular. It allows developers to organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality, such as components, directives, services, and pipes. Each Angular application has at least one NgModule, called the root module.
