# [01] What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional rows and columns.

# [02] What is a document in MongoDB?
A document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB, represented as a set of key-value pairs. It is analogous to a row in a relational database but can have nested structures and arrays.

# [03] Explain the structure of a MongoDB document.
A MongoDB document consists of fields and values, where each field is a unique identifier and each value can be of any data type supported by MongoDB, including strings, numbers, arrays, and nested documents.

# [04] What is a collection in MongoDB?
A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents. It is similar to a table in a relational database but does not enforce a schema, allowing for more flexibility.

# [05] What is the _id field in MongoDB?
The _id field is a unique identifier automatically assigned to each document in a collection. It ensures the uniqueness of documents within a collection and can be manually specified or generated by MongoDB.

# [06] What is a database in MongoDB?
A database is a physical container for collections. It is similar to a schema in a relational database and can contain multiple collections.

# [07] What is the difference between MongoDB and SQL databases?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a flexible document-oriented data model, while SQL databases use a rigid tabular data model with fixed schemas. MongoDB is schema-less, allowing for more dynamic and scalable data storage.

# [08] What is sharding in MongoDB?
Sharding is the process of distributing data across multiple machines to improve scalability and performance. MongoDB uses sharding to horizontally partition data based on a shard key.

# [09] What is the role of the mongod process in MongoDB?
The mongod process is the primary daemon process responsible for running the MongoDB server. It handles data storage, retrieval, and management operations.

# [10] What is a replica set in MongoDB?
A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain identical copies of data to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. It consists of primary and secondary nodes, along with optional arbiter nodes.

# [11] How do you create an index in MongoDB?
Indexes can be created in MongoDB using the createIndex() method, specifying the collection and the field(s) to index. MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single field, compound, multikey, and geospatial indexes.

# [12] Explain the find() method in MongoDB.
The find() method is used to query data from a collection in MongoDB. It retrieves documents that match the specified criteria and returns a cursor to iterate over the result set.

# [13] What is the aggregation framework in MongoDB?
The aggregation framework is a powerful tool for processing and transforming data in MongoDB. It allows for complex data aggregation operations, such as grouping, sorting, filtering, and performing mathematical calculations, using a pipeline of stages.

# [14] What is the findOne() method in MongoDB?
The findOne() method is used to retrieve a single document from a collection that matches the specified query criteria. It returns the first document found or null if no matching document is found.

# [15] What is the role of the mongos process in MongoDB?
The mongos process is the MongoDB shard router responsible for routing client requests to the appropriate shard in a sharded cluster. It acts as a gateway between clients and the MongoDB cluster.

# [16] How do you perform backups in MongoDB?
Backups in MongoDB can be performed using tools like mongodump for logical backups or file system snapshots for physical backups. Logical backups contain BSON data files that can be restored using mongorestore, while physical backups capture the entire database directory structure.

# [17] What is the $lookup aggregation stage in MongoDB?
The $lookup aggregation stage is used to perform a left outer join between two collections in MongoDB. It allows for cross-referencing documents from one collection with documents from another collection based on a specified field.

# [18] What is the purpose of the explain() method in MongoDB?
The explain() method is used to provide information about the query execution plan and performance statistics for a given query. It helps optimize query performance by analyzing index usage, query execution stages, and resource consumption.

# [19] What is the role of the mongotop command in MongoDB?
The mongotop command is used to monitor the read and write activity of MongoDB instances in real-time. It provides information about the most active collections and databases, helping identify performance bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.

# [20] What is a TTL index in MongoDB?
A TTL (Time-To-Live) index is a special type of index in MongoDB that automatically deletes documents from a collection after a specified period of time. It is commonly used for expiring data, such as session logs or temporary records.
These questions cover a range of MongoDB topics, from basic concepts to more advanced features and administration tasks. Depending on the job role and level of expertise required, interview questions may focus on specific areas of MongoDB.
