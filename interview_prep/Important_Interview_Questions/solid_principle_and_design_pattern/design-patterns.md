## **[Behavioral Pattern]**
#### [1] Strategic Pattern
Strategic design pattern, also known as the Strategy pattern, is a behavioral design pattern that allows selecting an algorithm at runtime from a family of algorithms. It encapsulates each algorithm and makes them interchangeable.

#### [2] Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

## **[Structural Pattern]**
#### [1] Decorator Pattern
The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is often used to extend the functionality of objects in a flexible and reusable way.

#### [2] Proxy Pattern
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the target object, providing additional functionality such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

#### [3] Composite Pattern
The Composite pattern is used when you need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

#### [4] Adapter pattern
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with another class.

#### [5] Bridge Pattern
The Bridge pattern decouples abstraction from implementation so that they can vary independently. It uses composition instead of inheritance to achieve this.

#### [6] Facade Pattern
The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It simplifies complex systems by providing a higher-level interface.

#### [7] Flyweight Pattern
The Flyweight pattern is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.
